🧠 Data Quest ML Hackathon - Financial Risk Prediction (2nd Place 🥈)
  This repository contains our solution for the Data Quest ML Hackathon, a national-level 24-hour machine learning competition focused on predicting financial risks using real-world, highly imbalanced datasets.

🏆 Achievement
  Secured 2nd place out of 400+ teams by building a high-performing predictive model tailored for imbalanced classification.

🔍 Problem Statement
  Develop a machine learning model to identify customers with potential financial risk ("bad_flag") based on anonymized customer and transaction data.
